## Overview

This online portfolio was built to showcase my software developement skills and projects in an accessable and interactive way for potential employers, collaberators and fellow developers. Developed using ASP.NET for both the backend and frontend, with a SQLite database to manage project data, this platform serves as a dynamic and flexible space for hosting content. The most notable port of this project is the hidden away admin pages, which allow me to manage all project related content and media. 

### Technologies

- Frontend: The frontend uses Razor Pages, CSS/SCSS and JS. Three.JS was also used to generate anique and impressive looking graphics
- Backend: The backend uses ASP.NET and C# with a custom built admin section
- Database: SQLite is used with Entity Framwork to store information about projects
- Other: Python scripts are used to convert Markdown files into JSON, which is used to display project pages (such as this)

## Features

### Admin Section

My custom-built admin section of this portfolio website is the most sophisticated part of the project. It features multiple pages, including a main dashboard for managing projects and a dedicated dashboard for handling various files—such as images, videos, and Markdown files—used across the site. The admin interface also includes specialized pages for uploading and organizing media, offering a streamlined experience for maintaining and updating content efficiently.

### Versatile Hosting for Projects

The portfolio website is designed to serve not only as a showcase of my work but also as a flexible platform for hosting smaller web projects. Instead of building a separate website for each idea, I can easily create new pages within this portfolio to display and experiment with various concepts. This approach allows for rapid development, seamless integration, and consistent styling across all projects, providing a unified experience for visitors.
