## Overview

Null Text Editor is a custom built text editor made completely from scratch. The idea was a simple text editor that had a command line style interface, without actually using the command line. Originally only supposed to be taking around a month to code, the project quickly grew and ended up taking much longer. This project ended up teaching me a lot about the software developement cycle before I even knew what that was.

## Technology & Programming

Null was written entirly in C++. What I wanted to do was recreate a console style interface from scratch and I did that using OpenGL. It uses simple graphics techniques to display textures to the screen for each letter, displaying text. All text controls and keyboard commands were added from scratch. 

## What I Learned

This project taught me a whole lot about software developement, and I learned a lot of skills during the lifetime of the project. First of all was C++ and OpenGL. Having no experience with either, I had to learn the basics of both, from scratch to create this project. While learning the essentials of OpenGL, I discovered a passion for graphics programming and developed a keen interest in both OpenGL and low-level graphics programming. I also developed botha hatred and love for C++.

As mentioned before, this project was my introduction to the software developement cycle...
