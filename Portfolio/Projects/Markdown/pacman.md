## Overview

This 3D Pacman game was my first major project, showcasing my early skills in game development. Originally conceived as a 3D Horror Pacman concept, the game evolved into a more traditional Pacman experience but with a unique twist: you play from Pacman's perspective. The game retains the core mechanics of the original Pacman series while offering new immersive features.

### Features

- 6 Unique maps based off of actual PacMan and Mrs PacMan maps
- Main menu, pause menu, and game over screen
- A settings menu to adjust certain settings
- Stats recording and a compreshensive stats menu
- Unlimited gameplay
- The original algorithms for ghosts

## Technology

The game is made in Unity 3D Game Engine and C#. I made all of the UI sprites myself using Krita.
